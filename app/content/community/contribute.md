## Shadcn-Docs & Nuxt Content

This project utilizes [Shadcn-Docs-Nuxt](https://shadcn-docs.nuxt.dev) module for a beautiful & feature-rich documentation out of the box based on [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com). You'll likely need to refer their docs often while working on a feature.

- Shadcn-Docs is in early development. If you encountered a bug. Consider submitting a PR upstream to Shadcn-Docs rather than this project. This benefits us and others using the module. Once its merged & released upstream we'll bump the module and get the newest updates.

- If you have a change in mind that seems specific to this project. You can always override Shadcn-Docs components by creating a new `.vue` file with the same name. We're already doing this with the following files and others
  -  `pages/[...slug].vue`
  - `pages/index.vue`
  - `components/layout/Header/Header.vue`
  - `components/layout/Aside.vue`

  ::alert{icon="ph:lightbulb-duotone"}
    You can use Nuxt Devtools' inspect to easily open the component you need. You can also check Shadcn-Docs source.
  ::

- Shadcn-Docs also exposes some shadcn-vue components such as `Input`, `Button`. Hence we don't need to re-add them in our project. If you added a new shadcn-vue component and got a warning in the console for duplicate components, this means the component is already added by Shadcn-Docs and you can use it directly without re-adding it.
  ::alert{type="warning" icon="ph:lightbulb-duotone"}
    For the components exported by Shadcn-Docs to work as expected. We must use the same `shadcn.componentPrefix` option in our `nuxt.config` as Shadcn-Docs which is `Ui`. Changing its value will break the components.
